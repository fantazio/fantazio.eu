This experiment uses the `dead_code_analyzer 1.2.0` on `opam 2.5.1`.
It is funded by the [OCaml Software Fundation](https://ocaml-sf.org/).

This is a follow up on the naive cleanup. We will re-examine the results with a more context-aware eye.

In order to achive that goal, we will reuse the cleanup done with the naive approach, check if it makes sense and undo it when not.

Let's re-explore the `dead_code_analyzer` results on `Opam` in the same order as for the naive cleanup.

### Unused exported values

The [report](/assets/reports/dca/opam/dca.out)'s unused exported values section initial content is 433 lines long after discarding the header, footer, and blank lines.

#### Client

This section focuses on reports in `/tmp/proj/opam/src/client`.

This component builds into the library [`opam-client`](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/opam-client/). Thus, we must be very careful when choosing to remove a value.

### Unused constructors/record fields

The [report](../assets/reports/dca/opam/dca.out)'s unused constructors/record fields section initial content is 75 lines long after discarding the header, footer, and blank lines.

#### Core

This section focuses on reports in `/tmp/proj/opam/src/core`.

It is, however, more complicated to verify
if a type component is used than a value component. The Serlocode search requires looking for places where the module is used, and then for the use of the component near those places.
